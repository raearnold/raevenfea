			<section>
								<p>2020 is over. That&#8217;s as good of a lede as you&#8217;re going to get on here this year.</p>
<p>Two years after stopping updates here, I&#8217;m still waffling on what to do with the site. I was ready to start blogging a bit more, but then 2020 happened. Life has changed so much this year, even separate from how it has changed for all of us. Among it all, we moved to Atlanta from Vermont permanently (or at least not intentionally temporarily, like last time). We&#8217;re going to have a tiny human to raise starting early next year. So we&#8217;ll see how 2021 goes.</p>
<p>But, as with last year, I&#8217;m dropping in to make a 2020 wrap up post to remind myself in the future that making things helped with so much this year as stress relief.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>I was surprised in late October when I sat down to catch up on History Quilt blocks and realized I&#8217;d made five quilts this year, including finishing the last few older (7+ years!) works in progress that I had sitting around.</p>

<h2>Quilt Shows</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, Exchanges</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Clothing</h2>
<p>Early in the year—especially once I started working from home in March—I was so motivated to sew clothing. That tanked in mid-May for a while (I thought it was pandemic fatigue + new job + move planning, but turns out it was also 1st trimester hormones), but even with a few months&#8217; break it all added up to quite a few new items of clothing.</p>

<p>With the exception of the swimsuit and the circle skirt for a gala in early Feb, it was all very loungy/comfy stuff and got so much wear this year.</p>
<h2>Other Sewing Projects</h2>
<p>When I wasn&#8217;t sewing clothing early in the year, I was making zip pouches out of sentimental things and odd scraps in an effort to downsize my stash before we downsized housing. I ended up making 20 over the course of the year.</p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3134" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zip-pouches.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<p>And masks. Although very few in the scheme of things because that was the opposite of stress relief for me.</p>
<p>And then a few baby items toward the end of the year.</p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/baby.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3131" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/baby-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/baby-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/baby-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/baby-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/12/baby.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<h3>Finished in 2020:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Witch&#8217;s Bubble Brew</li>
<li>Farmer’s wife / EPP Crosses – 16 blocks became a small quilt, rest were destashed</li>
<li>C+S Charm Quilt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Progress in 2020:</h3>
<p>Meta history quilt – blocks made for recent quilt projects</p>
<h3>Untouched:</h3>
<p>Pixelated Churn Dash – my new plan is to unpick the hour or two of straight line quilting I&#8217;ve done and send this queen bed-sized one out to a longarm quilter</p>
<h3>Destashed:</h3>
<p>Self-portrait of an American Woman</p>
<h3>New:</h3>
<p>Quilt top from leftovers of Reproduction Sky #2</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>Since life is going to change drastically for me in late January, my sole goal in 2021 for sewing is to make sure I carve out time for it more selfishly (but also more sustainably) than I ever have before, because it is my outlet for so much stress relief and creativity.</p>
<p>When we started thinking seriously about moving here to Georgia in late 2019 (with the idea of downsizing to a 700-800sq.ft. city apartment/condo as part of it), I started looking at my remaining unfinished projects and crafting inventory and slimmed it all down considerably. While I still have a stash of fabric (both quilting and a few cuts for garments), I&#8217;ve stopped earmarking it for specific future plans right now. Other than the quilt projects mentioned in the backlog (which have their binding and backings completed too), the only project I have supplies set aside for is a pair of jeans. I&#8217;d like to actually tackle that in the second half of 2021—I planned to do so this year, but maternity body happened. Otherwise I&#8217;ll see where my whims take me.</p>

								<p>I haven&#8217;t yet decided if I&#8217;m going to jump back into blogging again for 2020. I&#8217;ve been enjoying the shorter form of Instagram for sharing, so I may find a way to publish cross-platform. But, I wanted to drop in and add a 2019 wrap up here as much (or more) for myself than anyone else.</p>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>I sewed a lot this year, but very little of it was quilting. I only completed two quilts.</p>
<figure>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-quilts.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3123" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-quilts-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-quilts-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-quilts-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-quilts-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzPFg-mn_kY/">You Are Welcome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7PB901nTfd/">Linen BOM</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Quilt Shows</h2>
<p>The only reason I managed to finish You Are Welcome was because I entered it in VQF. So, it hung there, winning a yellow ribbon. <a href="/quilts/q016dc/">Human</a> and a small challenge project I made this year (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwQFXBvHWOX/">Tiger Splash</a>) have both been hanging since September in a public space here in Burlington along with other quilts made by fellow guildmates. (If you&#8217;re in the area, they&#8217;re on the second floor of the Innovation Center on Lakeside Ave for the foreseeable future.)</p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, Exchanges</h2>
<p>I tried keeping up with my guild&#8217;s block of the month this year and made it to month 10. I decided to call it quits at that point, and finished the quilt top at our fall retreat (on a smaller scale) and quilted it in late November.</p>
<h2>Clothing</h2>
<p>This is a category I haven&#8217;t included for a few years, but it&#8217;s back with a vengeance. After receiving a serger for Christmas 2018, I dove in to playing with both knits and woven clothing.</p>
<figure>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-clothing.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3122" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-clothing-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-clothing-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-clothing-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-in-review-clothing-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<ol>
<li>Flannel PJ Pants (for Carl, a Simplicity pattern that I don&#8217;t recall the number)</li>
<li>Black Helen&#8217;s Closet Avery Leggings</li>
<li>Silver Foiled Cake Tiramisu</li>
<li>Cashmerette Concord Tee</li>
<li>Teal Merino Colette Myrtle Dress</li>
<li>Helen&#8217;s Closet Avery Leggings Undershorts</li>
<li>Maxi Colette Myrtle Dress</li>
<li>Black Velvet Cashmerette Upton Bridesmaid Dress</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus, a few shirt refashions and repairs. I started the year with a #makeNine2019 grid that mixed clothing and quilting, mostly focused on #remakeNine2019 where I tried replacing things I already owned rather than adding new things to the mix. I managed to finish six of the nine.</p>
<p>I have a few projects (and their supplies) lined up for 2020 as well (like the Cashmerette Ames Jeans I didn&#8217;t make), so stay tuned (on Insta, at least) as I attempt balance my minimalist wardrobe  with a desire to make all the (sartorial) things.</p>
<h2>Other Sewing Projects</h2>
<p>In addition to the clothing projects, I sewed a variety of small things. While dealing with a lot of migraines and anxiety in the first half of the year, I sewed zip pouches as a way to keep myself in the practice of making even when I didn&#8217;t feel into it (or much else). Between those, gifts, samples for a workshop I taught, and the seven that I made for my sister&#8217;s bachelorette weekend, I made a total of 22 zip pouches and two laptop cases (which are basically tall skinny OWPs).</p>
<p>Other projects included a one hour basket, a Purl Soho adjustable apron, coasters, bunting, a Portsmith tote, and a variety of other small things.</p>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<p>Perhaps in the future I should add clothing to this as well (I&#8217;ve had a knit cardigan cut out since May, waiting to be serged together), but for now I&#8217;ll leave it with the quilt projects I usually keep here.</p>
<h3>Progress in 2019:</h3>
<p>Meta history quilt – blocks made for recent quilt projects<br>
Witches Bubble Brew – quilt top completed, partially quilted</p>
<h3>Untouched:</h3>
<p>Farmer’s wife / EPP Crosses – I destashed almost all of the fabric for this, so I&#8217;ll be figuring something out for what is left soon.<br>
Self-portrait of an American Woman – unsure of whether I&#8217;ll finish this. I&#8217;ve only made a tiny block or two.<br>
Pixelated Churn Dash – basted, partially quilted<br>
C+S Charm Quilt – quilt top complete</p>
<h3>New:</h3>
<p>none! (a first!)</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time in 2019 sorting through my stuff and decluttering. While I don&#8217;t want to limit myself down to the bare sewing supplies I had in Atlanta in 2018, I also felt like I tend to expand to my surroundings like a koi. I got rid of a lot of supplies for crafts I know I won&#8217;t work on (knitting, crocheting, needlepoint). Crafting is a space that I&#8217;m very bad about keeping things just in case, but being honest with myself, there are a lot of things that I know I&#8217;m never going to choose to do over other crafts or projects. So, I&#8217;m trying to be much more intentional about what comes in, what stays, and remember that I have the resources to go out and buy something if I do get rid of it and find I need it again later. Plus, it helps me focus on finishing the projects I have in progress rather than jumping to the next new shiny thing. In 2020, I want to focus on sewing through some of the projects I have supplies for before moving on to new things.</p>

								<p>As I sat down to write this year’s review post, I realized that I was behind on posting by multiple quilts and other projects yet again. And worse, it wasn’t due to a lack of time like last year, but general lack of motivation.</p>
<p>So, after spending a couple of weeks thinking about it, I’ve decided that I’m going to stop blogging in 2019. For now, this site will stay up. Thank you to those of you who have stuck around all these years.</p>
<p>Catch me on Instagram, where I’m slightly better about posting finished projects and in progress shots. My sewjo was back in 2018 despite all of the moving, and I’m looking forward to many new techniques and projects in 2019. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raevenfea/">@raevenfea</a></p>
<hr>
<p>That said, here&#8217;s 2018 in review.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3114"> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-review.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3114" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-review-1024x683.jpg" alt="2018 Review — Five Finished Quilts" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-review-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-review-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-review-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-review.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>2018 Review — Five Finished Quilts</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t finish nearly as many quilts this year as I have in the past, and most of them were rather small quilts. But, I did manage to knock off one old work in progress and a second that was not as old, but I was just as pleased about clearing out.</p>
<p>1. Volute (Bang!)<br>
2. <a href="/quilting/wild-swoon/">Wild Swoon</a><br>
3. <a href="/quilting/welcome/">Welcome</a><br>
4. Give a Flock<br>
5. Welcome 2</p>
<p>It was the year of small quilts. All but Volute (Bang!) were 42&#8243; square or smaller. It almost motivates me to start the process of quilting my giant pixelated churn dash again (queen bed-sized, 1/2&#8243; lines).</p>
<h2>Quilt Shows</h2>
<p>Volute (Bang!) hung at the Vermont Quilt Festival. <a href="/quilts/q014bi/">Mustang Summing</a>, <a href="/quilting/of-all-the-ys/">All the Ys</a>, and <a href="/quilting/the-sum-of-scraps/">The Sum of Scraps</a> all hung at the T. W. Wood Gallery in Montpelier, VT for a show in October.</p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, Exchanges</h2>
<p>Give a Flock finished up the Block of the Month my guild kicked off in mid-2017. I signed up for our 2018-19 BOM as well, and three months in, I’m still caught up.</p>
<p>Welcome was started after I learned about the <a rel="external" href="https://www.welcomeblanket.org/" target="_blank">Welcome Blanket Project</a>. I gifted it to the project after finishing it.</p>
<h2>Other Sewing Projects</h2>
<p>While I was living in Atlanta, I took advantage of the wide variety of classes I could access and different materials I could buy in-person. As a result, I did more non-quilt sewing than usual. That included knit leggings, a sweater/sweatshirt, a waxed-canvas bag, and espadrille shoes. That&#8217;s in addition to a variety of zip pouches, and random other small projects; none of these made the blog.</p>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<p>Aside from the two quilts I finished from this backlog (Volute, formerly Organic Spins; VTMQG 2017-18 BOM), I didn&#8217;t make much progress on it. I&#8217;m actively working on the one new quilt I started but didn&#8217;t manage to finish in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Progress in 2018:</strong><br>
Meta history quilt</p>
<p><strong>Untouched:</strong><br>
Farmer&#8217;s wife / EPP Crosses<br>
Witches Bubble Brew<br>
Self-portrait of an American Woman<br>
Pixelated Churn Dash</p>
<p><strong>New:</strong><br>
C+S Charm Quilt</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>One thing that was reinforced by my time in Atlanta is that I love sewing with people and learning new things. Sure, I can puzzle pretty much any technique out, but I enjoy learning them in person, with others. Rather than focusing goals on how many projects I might complete in 2019, I want to focus on learning things with people—taking classes, going to sew-ins, etc. I think there may be more garment sewing in my future as well, after reigniting that passion and receiving a serger for xmas.</p>

								<p>As well as I can remember, 2017 is the first year that I am incredibly relieved to see in my metaphorical rearview mirror. So long, 2017, and keep your fish next time.</p>
<p>My time and motivation for sewing got pushed aside in favor of dealing with life. There were certainly some highs to go along with the lows, don&#8217;t get me wrong—we traveled to Alaska for our 10th anniversary, for starters! But overall, the theme of 2017 sewing seemed to be &#8220;whip up this gift before a deadline,&#8221; and had very little &#8220;me time, addicted to this project&#8221; sewing.</p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-year-review.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3027" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-year-review-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-year-review-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-year-review-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-year-review-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-year-review.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>2017 was all about babies. So many baby quilts. And, a lack of blogging. I still owe you all some words about numbers six, seven, and eight.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/quilting/treasure-ohana/">Treasure Ohana Quilt</a></li>

</ol>
<p>I also finished a mini, <a href="/quilting/of-all-the-ys/">“All the Ys”</a>, that took up a third of my Instagram #2017bestnine slots (of course, then I decided to be lame and not even post the collage to Instagram after it generated). I never quite know how to categorize minis—part of my list of quilts (currently 52 finishes, not including minis)—or part of my list of random small projects every year? Something to think about in the future if I start making more than one or two a year, I suppose.</p>
<p>* This isn&#8217;t exactly a finished quilt, but is a completed iteration. Semantics.</p>
<h2>Quilt Shows</h2>
<p><a href="/quilts/q016dc/">Human</a> hung at the Vermont Quilt Fest and won a second place ribbon on its own merits. <a href="/quilting/cyclist/">Cyclist</a> was also present at VQF, in the &#8220;Lobby Lights&#8221; exhibit along with many others by my guildmates.</p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, Exchanges</h2>
<p>With my crafting mojo as limited as it was, I didn&#8217;t get involved in much this year. I started participating in my guild&#8217;s block of the month, but only finished the first two months. I&#8217;m about six behind at this point (we started mid-year). I helped my guild piece <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/quiltsforqc/">#quiltsforqc</a> quilt tops during a sew-in, but that was it for various collaborative projects.</p>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<p>I barely touched my existing project backlog this year. I did finish one old project, <a href="/quilting/sampler-on-point/">Sampler On Point</a>, which officially finishes off my old sampler projects from Utica. And, I made the first full panel of my history quilt (48 blocks). But, I started two projects in May that I didn&#8217;t touch again after August or so, which means I&#8217;m technically net negative on backlog progress.</p>
<p><strong>Progress in 2017:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meta history quilt</li>
<li>Farmer&#8217;s wife / EPP Crosses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Untouched:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Witches Bubble Brew</li>
<li>Organic Spins</li>
<li>Self-portrait of an American Woman</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Giant Pixelated Churn Dash</li>
<li>2017-8 VTMQG BOM</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>Looking back at <a href="/news/2016-in-review/">my 2016 review</a>, I didn&#8217;t do a great job of being on the same playing field as my goals for 2017, let alone accomplishing them. Which, of course, makes me hesitant to make any goals for 2018.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;d like to finish a quilt to enter into VQF this year. I&#8217;ve found the feedback from judges very interesting for the previous two years. At the time of writing, I hope to finish up <a href="/quilting/flirting-with-masochism-and-warnings/">Organic Spins</a> once and for all, and enter it. I started it in September 2011, which makes it my oldest work in progress that I&#8217;m still trying to finish as originally envisioned.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to catch up on posting about my final finishes of 2017 before too late in the year and keep up in 2018. Thanks for sticking around!</p>

								<p>When I sat down to write this, it struck me that my opening could be much the same as <a href="/news/2015-in-review/">last year’s</a>. Again, we traveled quite a bit. Again, I changed roles at work (back into development, still team leadership). But, I also spent weeks on end not entering my studio space, not sewing, not dreaming up projects. I posted the fewest updates here since I started keeping this blog in 2009. So, this will be a pretty minimal roundup for the year.</p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-year-review.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2953" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2953" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-year-review-1024x683.jpg" alt="2016 in review @raevenfea" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-year-review-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-year-review-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-year-review-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-year-review.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>I was surprised to realize that I finished one more quilt this year than last. The finishes fell evenly into three categories: baby quilt gifts, donations to my guild’s community quilt drive, and ones I kept.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/tag/q016da/">Pear Tree of Life</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/the-miniatures-nine-patch/">Miniatures Heart Nine-patch</a></li>
<li><a href="/quilts/q016dc/">Human</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/q016dd/">Brilliant Frippery</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/double-wedding-ring/">Jewelry Box (Double Wedding Ring Remix)</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/cottons-etc-sampler/">Cotton Candy (2013 Cotton’s Etc. Sampler)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Every quilt I finished this year was either a pre-existing work in progress or made from stash. I’m happy to see my backlog of started projects shrink a little more. Despite the stash projects, my collection of fabric actually increased exponentially this year (more on that later), but it was nice to use up some of the older bits.</p>
<h2>Quilt Shows</h2>
<p>Despite not blogging, I did more to show my work in real life than I have in past years.</p>
<p><a href="/quilts/q015cd/">The F-word</a> hung at the Vermont Quilt Fest. I don’t think it was very well received, but one of the judges gave me some insightful feedback, so it was a satisfying experience.</p>
<p>Human hung at the Squam Modern Quilt Show hosted by the Cambridge MQG and Gather Here, as well as in a special exhibit by the Vermont MQG at the Champlain Valley Quilt Guild’s show this year (an exhibit I also organized, which ate up a chunk of time).</p>
<p>After four years of traveling the country (and to Canada), my <a href="/tag/1812-quilt-challenge/">1812 Challenge Quilt</a> finally came home this summer.</p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, Exchanges</h2>
<p>I signed up for the Mighty Lucky Quilting Challenges this year, but only completed two of the challenges. January’s bias tape challenge resulted in <a href="/quilting/bias-tape-challenge-orange-belt/">a mini art quilt</a>, and I made <a href="/quilting/books-brains-and-pillows/">a pillow of quilted words</a> as a result of June’s challenge.</p>
<p>I also made a few blocks for two quilt drives (along with other members of my guild): <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/quiltsforfortmac/" rel="external">#quiltsforfortmac</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/quiltsforpulse/" rel="external">#quiltsforpulse</a>.</p>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<p><strong>Progress in 2016</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2013 Sampler from Tiger Lily</li>
<li>Meta history quilt</li>
<li>Farmer’s wife / EPP Crosses</li>
<li>Witches Bubble Brew</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Untouched</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organic Spins</li>
<li>Work in Progress</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Self-portrait of an American Woman</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>I find myself hesitant to make any resolutions for 2017, but if I were to do so, it’d be as simple as &#8220;spend more time creating.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the year draws to a close, two articles I read this year have really stuck with me and will likely play a role in how I look at things in the coming year. In the first (from 2014), Cheryl Arkison talks about why she doesn’t limit the number of projects she currently has &#8220;under construction.” (link no longer available) As someone who spent the previous three years making a concerted effort to reduce the number of works in progress I have, it may seem odd that in many ways I agree with her. But as she discusses in the section about creative challenges, I do think there can be value in having a variety of projects to work on. A lot of my focus has been on clearing out projects that never really called to me in the first place, but that I didn’t want to abandon. What is left is a collection of very different ideas that are simply waiting for me to be in the right mood to explore.</p>
<p>The other was <a href="http://whileshenaps.com/2016/11/language-matters-making-quilting-more-inclusive.html" rel="external">Abby Glassenberg’s article about how language matters</a> and the often exclusionary nature of how we talk about quilting. While I think the entire article is spot on, the section at the end about fabric stashes struck a particular chord. I purchased over 60 yards (yes, really! I couldn’t believe it either) of fabric this year. Some was to supplement what I already had to finish in-progress projects, but much of it was taking advantage of sales two local shops were running (one was moving, the other closing). Mere days before the article came out, I made one of those throwaway small-talk jokes to the fabric store clerk at checkout about my husband’s likely horror of such a large purchase and maybe I should sneak it inside. It was also mostly a lie, because he doesn’t really care and I felt no guilt (also: I’m a terribly awkward person in conversation most days, especially for small talk). It was one of those things we say to act like everyone else. Just like all the brainless micro aggressions that continue to feed racism, sexism, ageism, all the other -isms. In other words, this is the year that I managed to turn buying fabric into a great philosophical event for myself.</p>
<p>That’s all a really long way of obliquely saying that in 2017 you should expect more ‘statement’ projects (a lá F-word, Human), and more stash projects (fabric palette projects?).</p>

								<p>2015 was an odd year—it went by in a flash and I sewed much less than I have in recent years. We traveled more than in the past and for longer stretches of time. I started a new role that is less about development and more about guiding a team, became co-leader of our local Girl Develop It chapter (an organization that aims to teach women to code), and made progress with the learning curve of both of those changes. Sewing (especially quilting) took a back seat. What I did sew, I did with real intention and a certain level of dumping things out of my brain and sewing space.</p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-in-review.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2744" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-in-review.jpg" alt="2015-in-review" width="2048" height="1365" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2744"></a></figure>
<p>At the end of 2014, I made a resolution to clean out my works in progress (the quilting ones, at least). Three-fifths of my quilt finishes this year came from that collection, and I worked on a few others. The second part of the resolution—that I not add to the list—wasn&#8217;t met. I started two projects that are still unfinished.</p>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="/Q015CA">Puzzle Bop</a></li>
<li>
<a href="/Q015CB">Wheeling Ruffles (Sevillanas)</a>*</li>
<li>
<a href="/Q015CC">Altered Steps</a>*</li>
<li><a href="/Q015CD">The F-word</a></li>
<li>
<a href="/Q015CE">State Line Memories</a>*</li>
</ol>
<p><small>* denotes a long-term work in progress that I finished</small></p>
<p>For the first time, this year was about finishing things—and in one case making a statement—not about gifting. In fact, the only quilt of the five gifted was the first—a quilt for a new cousin in my generation.</p>
<p>Getting the F-word out of my head and into a quilt was extraordinarily satisfying, and one of the unfinished projects is something else in that vein.</p>
<h2>Sartorial Projects</h2>
<p>My one wearable was a <a href="/news/halloween-2015-mary-sanderson/">Halloween/Cosplay costume for Mary Sanderson</a>. I&#8217;ve loved <i class="title movie-title">Hocus Pocus</i> for 20 years, and was happy to jump in when my coworkers wanted to dress up as the three Sanderson Sisters for our office costume contest.</p>
<h2>Crafty Things</h2>
<p>Not only was this a slow year for quilting, I sewed very few smaller craft items.</p>
<p>My <a href="/quilting/the-art-student-and-the-cottage-garden/">Art Student and the Cottage Garden</a> bag is an all-time favorite and took about the same amount of effort as a typical quilt. </p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, and Exchanges</h2>
<p>I contributed blocks to two charity quilts for my guild, pieced the back for one of those, and made a block for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tknauersews/photos/a.301572663192580.96894.212737125409468/1117754894907682/?type=3&#038;theater" rel="external">a quilt Thomas Knauer is doing</a>.</p>
<p>But, I did nothing with others that will end up in a project of my own.</p>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<p>Again, this was the year of cleaning out works in progress. I went into detail on the ones I made progress on in a <a href="/quilting/mid-year-progress/">Mid-year Progress</a> post. </p>
<p>Progress since the progress report: I finished one quilt, decided Drunkard&#8217;s Compass will never be completed as designed and returned the fabrics to my stash (there are a few blocks finished that may turn into a pillow cover or something next year), and found the heart block for the Miniatures 9-Patch during a massive organizational spree in November.</p>
<p><strong>Progress made:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Farmer&#8217;s wife / EPP Crosses</li>
<li>Miniatures 9-patch</li>
<li>Witches Bubble Brew</li>
<li>Drunkard&#8217;s Compass</li>
<li>Meta history quilt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Untouched:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organic Spins</li>
<li>Double Wedding Ring</li>
<li>2013 Samplers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I Am Human</li>
<li>Work in Progress (such a meta name)</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Resolution</h2>
<p>I have a couple of very specific finishing goals for 2016: I Am Human, Work In Progress, Miniatures 9-patch, and a baby quilt in January.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the majority of my guild (including me) decided to participate in the <a href="http://luckyspool.com/products/mighty-lucky-quilting-club">Mighty Lucky Quilting Club</a> so I want to keep up with that. </p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1357.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2749" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1357.jpg" alt="Organization" width="1536" height="2048" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2749"></a></figure>
<p>I finally organized the larger pieces of my stash (comic book boards as mini-bolts for the win). I hope I can keep up with having my sewing room organized. I still need to deal with all of my scraps that are hidden in various bins and boxes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m loathe to commit to much, because I think 2016 is going to turn out much like 2015 in terms of work and traveling. Looking forward to seeing how it goes!</p>

								<p>When wedding planning took over all my free time during the spring and summer, I didn&#8217;t expect to finish many quilts this year. Once the day had passed and life settled back to normal, however, I found myself manic with quilting motivation. In the end, I finished two more quilts than in 2013!</p>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-in-review1.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-in-review1.jpg" alt="2014-in-review" width="1024" height="768" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2349" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-in-review1.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-in-review1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<p>In January, I posted about wanting to <a href="/quilting/2014-skill-improvement-goal-binding/">improve my skill at binding</a>. I ended up only hand binding one quilt (Stars For Lennon) and feel much more comfortable machine binding. Yay!</p>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="/Q014BA">Wonders of Impromptu</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BB">Peter Rabbit Mopsy Green</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BC">Peter Rabbit Flopsy Purple</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BD">Noble Blooms</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BE">Stars for Lennon</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BF">Road to Community</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BG">Carissima (HC T-shirt Quilt)</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BH">Bird’s Nest Quilt</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BI">Mustang Summing</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q014BJ">V’s Morse Message</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Four of the quilts were made with specially-purchased fabric, three were entirely from stash, two only required a purchase for backing, and one was an even mix of stash and new purchases. Additionally, three were long-time works in progress which I’m happy to be done with. Better yet, I didn&#8217;t start any quilts that weren&#8217;t finished this year.</p>
<h2>Sartorial Projects</h2>
<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10426655_10152454357208560_458996983112972103_n.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10426655_10152454357208560_458996983112972103_n.jpg" alt="10426655_10152454357208560_458996983112972103_n" width="960" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2342" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10426655_10152454357208560_458996983112972103_n.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10426655_10152454357208560_458996983112972103_n-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></figure>
<p>Despite purchasing fabric lengths for a few different dresses, I only finished one, and never managed to blog about it (or take blog photos, for that matter). It&#8217;s a second Tiramisu that I have worn so often that the cheap jersey is starting to pill, and needs to be taken in from stretching out. I guess that is a good thing, in this case?</p>
<h2>Crafty Things</h2>
<p>The unofficial theme for crafty projects this year was embroidery, evidently. I embroidered a few things for the wedding that went unblogged (a lingerie bag for me, Carl&#8217;s pocket square, and jewelry bags for my bridesmaids). I also made tea towels, potholders, keychains, and stockings in addition to the typical mix of doll quilts and stuffed animals.</p>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, and Exchanges</h2>
<p>None this year! Now that we&#8217;ve started an official Modern Quilt Guild here in VT, perhaps that will change in 2015.</p>
<p><a href="/Q014BF/">One of those quilt finishes</a> was from a previous sampler, though.</p>
<h2>The Backlog</h2>
<p>For once, I didn&#8217;t add to this list. I even managed to remove three things from it (well, technically I only remembered to add one of them to the 2013 Year in Review, but the other two should have been listed).</p>
<p>These are projects in progress for which something is cut out, at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmer&#8217;s wife / EPP Crosses</li>
<li>Organic Spins</li>
<li>Altar steps</li>
<li>Miniatures 9-patch</li>
<li>Witches Bubble Brew</li>
<li>Drunkard&#8217;s Compass</li>
<li>Double Wedding Ring</li>
<li>High-school t-shirt quilt</li>
<li>2013 Samplers</li>
<li>Meta history quilt</li>
</ul>
<p>I have one or two more with all the components sitting in a box, waiting to be cut.</p>
<p>And, on the blogging side of things, I should probably finish up this site redesign!</p>
<h2>A Resolution</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what 2015 will bring. I would like to continue making quilts for our nieces and nephews (six down, seven to go), and there are a few other people in our lives I&#8217;d like to create something for.</p>
<p>The one resolution I will make is that by this time next year, I&#8217;ll have done something with every unfinished quilt project listed above. Something might be progress, might be finishing, might even be officially giving up and repurposing/donating the completed parts—there just will be momentum of some sort. And, I won&#8217;t add to the list.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good way to start, at least.</p>

								<p>2014 is here, and I’ve started taking stock of what sewing projects are coming up next. 2013 was certainly full of change for me, but that translated to what felt like a less productive sewing year.</p>
<figure><a href="/media/2013-review.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1893" src="/media/2013-review-468x351.jpg" alt="2013-review" width="468" height="351"></a></figure>
<p>I didn&#8217;t actually fulfill any of <a href="/news/2012-in-review/">my sewing resolutions for 2013</a>, but I wouldn&#8217;t call the year a total loss. One major theme: I don&#8217;t have a bunch of abandoned <abbr title="Works in Progress">WIPs</abbr> from the year like I have in the past; I either finished everything I started, or am still consistently working on it for the most part.</p>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>I say 2013 &#8220;felt like a less productive year&#8221;, but I actually finished one more quilt than I did in 2012.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/Q013AA/">Shakespearian Bars: An English Interpretation</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q013AB/">Disappearing Seven Wonders</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q013AC/">Amish Sampler</a></li>

<li><a href="/Q013AG/">Reproduction Sky</a></li>
<li><a href="/Q013AH/">Thorny Patchwork</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Sartorial and Costume Projects</h2>
<p>My big win of the year was finally <a title="A Bit of Dessert" href="/sartorial/dessert/">finishing a Tiramisu in December</a>. I also made Butterick B5814 for Halloween, but don&#8217;t have photos or a post about it.</p>
<h2>Crafty Things</h2>
<p>There were a few quick projects I didn&#8217;t blog about (like very simple drawstring and Velcro bags for wrapping Christmas gifts, tote bags, and the like), but I did do a few here and there.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/crafting/savannah-bop-box-sewn-up/">A finished WIP box from Savannah Bop</a></li>
<li><a href="/crafting/christmas-in-june/">Late Christmas 2012 presents for my Mom</a></li>
<li><a href="/crafting/the-bagmakers-self/">An EPP-carrying bag for myself</a></li>
<li>
<a href="/crafting/foto-freitag-17/">More zippered cosmetic bags</a> at least <a href="/crafting/salvage-into-small-bag/">two of which I photographed</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, and Exchanges</h2>
<p>The notable finish here was <a href="/Q013AD/">Swapped Stories</a>, from the block swap I started in 2012.</p>
<p>I started two Saturday Samplers, but stopped after just a few blocks because of the move. All of the blocks I received are done, but they are packed away awaiting some rainy day.</p>
<h2>Fails and Projects I Got Bored With or Ignored for Too Long</h2>
<p>This list grew just a bit, because I didn&#8217;t complete a single project from it in 2013. I really do hope to focus on these in 2014.</p>
<ol>
<li>2011: <a href="/tag/the-miniatures-nine-patch/">Miniatures Heart Nine-Patch</a>—saw some cutting board action in 2013 (strips cut into pieces for 9-patches), but nothing more.</li>
<li>2011: <a href="/tag/organic-spins/">Organic Spins</a>—I made more progress in 2013, but it&#8217;s still not complete. I have everything I need, I just need to finish appliqueing and quilting.</li>
<li>2011: <a href="/tag/drunkards-compass/">Drunkard’s Compass</a>—needs a lot of work.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="/tag/witches-bubble-brew/">Witches’ Bubble Brew</a>—is fully pieced, but needs a lot of applique and then finishing.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="/tag/double-wedding-ring/">Double Wedding Ring</a>—was not touched in 2013.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="/tag/plumleigh-augusta-babbage/">The Steampunk Costume</a>—is never going to be finished with the original plan, but I’d like to do something with all of it.</li>
<li>2012-13: <a href="/tag/english-paper-piecing/">Farmer&#8217;s wife / EPP Crosses</a>—I did some EPP this year with a group in the spring and on my own as recently as Thanksgiving, but it has a long way to go and I only touch it every couple of months.</li>
<li>2012-13: <a href="/tag/tiger-lily-saturday-sampler/">Tiger Lily Saturday Sampler</a>—all 12 blocks are complete, but I haven&#8217;t started piecing them together.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>I have three quilts in progress that were started in late 2013 which are my main focus for early 2014 (two December babies, one January birthday). There are two more babies due to friends in the spring, so the first half of the year seems pretty full.</p>
<p>Aside from those planned quilts, I&#8217;m resolution-less this year. I want to see where the year takes me here in <abbr title="Vermont">VT</abbr>. I joined the local guild, but have only attended one meeting so far. I haven&#8217;t found a real quilt-shop home yet, nor any monthly groups. It&#8217;s an adventure I&#8217;m looking forward to.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck (or all the motivation) in 2014!</p>

								<p>Considering that we’re a day away from March, it is probably a bit late for a review of last year. But, since I found this in my drafts and find it helpful to refer back to, I’m publishing it now to motivate me to do even more in 2013. </p>
<h2>Quilt Finishes</h2>
<p>I had a goal of finishing 10 quilts in 2012. I didn’t make it, but I’m happy with the ones I did finish.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/quilting/1812-finished-shown-undocumented/">1812 Quilt Challenge Quilt</a></li>
<li><a href="/quilting/tula-does-up-the-walls-in-pah-ree/">Tula Does Up the Walls in Pah-ree</a></li>
<li><a href="/quilting/superfluous-tula/">Tula Leftovers</a></li>
<li><a href="/quilting/a-ruffled-baby-quilt/">Ruffled Baby Quilt</a></li>
<li><a href="/quilting/cyclist/">Cyclist</a></li>
<li><a href="/quilting/impressions-baby-quilt/">Impressions Baby Quilt</a></li>
<li>
<a href="/patterns/1-roll-1-yard-4-quilts/">4 Cuddle Quilts from 1 Jelly Roll</a> (I’m counting these as one, but if you count them individually, that is 10 for the year!)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Sartorial and Costume Projects</h2>
<p>I finished some things to be worn. Not all for me.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/sartorial/wrapping-up-at-market/">A Wrap Skirt for Thomas Knauer</a></li>
<li><a href="/sartorial/simplicity-2245-a-new-dress-tunic/">A Tunic/Dress for me</a></li>
<li>An 1812 Ensemble which I still haven’t photographed or blogged about</li>
</ol>
<h2>Crafty Things</h2>
<p>I made quite a few small projects. Here’re some of my favorites.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/crafting/forget-about-vera-b-this-is-rachael-a/">Vera Bradley-inspired Bag</a></li>
<li><a href="/crafting/a-pair-of-pillows/">A Pair of Pillows</a></li>
<li><a href="/crafting/another-year/">A Bra Challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/simplicity-2613/">Countless more Simplicity 2613 stuffed animals</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Samplers, Meetups, and Exchanges</h2>
<p>I participated in some swaps and samplers that will go on into 2013, as well as a monthly EPP sit-and-stitch.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/tag/tiger-lily-saturday-sampler/">Tiger Lily Saturday Sampler</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/block-swaps/">Puss in the Corner Block Swap</a></li>
<li><a href="/tag/english-paper-piecing/">English Paper Piecing</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Fails and Projects I Got Bored With or Ignored For Too Long</h2>
<p>These are my guilty secrets. The projects that I started and then just stopped for some reason or other (generally to work on something else). These are my goals for 2013.</p>
<ol>
<li>2011: <a href="/tag/the-miniatures-nine-patch/">Miniatures Heart Nine-Patch</a>—I haven’t touched for two years.</li>
<li>2011: <a href="/tag/organic-spins/">Organic Spins</a>—I made some progress, but I want to finish it by this September. I have everything I need, I just need to finish appliqueing and quilting.</li>
<li>2011: <a href="/tag/drunkards-compass/">Drunkard’s Compass</a>—needs a lot of work.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="/tag/witches-bubble-brew/">Witches’ Bubble Brew</a>—is partially pieced, but needs a lot of applique.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="/tag/double-wedding-ring/">Double Wedding Ring</a>—is not going to be a DWR, but I do want to finish something with the rings that are complete and the remaining fabric.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="/tag/plumleigh-augusta-babbage/">The Steampunk Costume</a>—is never going to be finished with the original plan, but I’d like to do something with all of it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Resolution</h2>
<p>I wish I could say I am going to focus on finishing up those fails and boring projects instead of starting new projects in 2013, but that would be a <strong>huge</strong> lie, knowing myself.</p>
<p>I just shipped off a quilt started and finished this year, and have another brand new top completed. I also started a new sampler, a new <abbr title="Sew You Want to Quilt">SYWTQ</abbr> group project, and have already failed at completing a <a href="http://sewingcake.com/30-minutes-a-day-tiramisu-knit-dress-sewalong/" rel="external">Tiramisu during the sew-along</a>.</p>
<p>However, I do resolve to finish at least one quilt top before starting anything new after quilting the aforementioned top. And I resolve to finish Organic Spins before my guild’s show in September. </p>
<p>There. It’s in writing. Now to start doing it.</p>
